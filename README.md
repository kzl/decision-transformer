## Instructions

We provide code in two sub-directories: `atari` containing code for Atari experiments and `gym` containing code for OpenAI Gym experiments.
**See corresponding READMEs in each folder for instructions**; scripts should be run from the respective directories.
It may be necessary to add the respective directories to your PYTHONPATH.
